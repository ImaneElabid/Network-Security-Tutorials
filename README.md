This repository provides several samples of code that might be useful for your Network Security problem sets and project.

## Google Protocol Buffers with sockets

Some sample code on how to use Google protobuf to create and parse messages for network communications.

## ZeroMQ with Sockets

Some sample code for networked communications using basic ZMQ patterns.

## Crypto in Python

Some sample python code demonstrating a variety of cryptographic building blocks (e.g., hashing, encryption, integrity protection).
